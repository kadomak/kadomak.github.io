Hi, I'm Kowe (co-weh)! I am a second year PhD student at Cornell Tech studying Information Science. I am broadly interested in the intersesction of human-computer interaction (HCI), natural language processing (NLP), and algorithmic fairness. As a member of the [Social Technologies Lab](https://s.tech.cornell.edu/), I examine the social and ethical implications of AI-mediated communication (AIMC). I also explore how developers create fair algorithms. I take an interdisciplinary approach to my work, drawing upon computer science, sociolinguistics, ethics, and law. My work has been supported by The National GEM Consortium and Cornell's Digital Life Initiative. I am an active member in the [AI Policy and Practice](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/) group and [CTRL-ALT](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/ctrl-alt) group. 

Previously, I received a B.S., summa cum laude, in Computer Engineering from Florida A&M University. As an undergrad, I had a myriad of research experiences from biomedical engineering to ethics. I have worked on several patent matters at law firms and in-house.
