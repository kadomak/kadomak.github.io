Hi, I’m Kowe (co-weh)! I am a 4th year PhD candidate at Cornell Tech in Information Science. In the [Social Technologies Lab](https://s.tech.cornell.edu/), I develop evaluation frameworks to characterize new harms in AI systems and design interventions to create safe, trustworthy, and inclusive AI. In my work, I use mixed methods approaches from human-computer interaction (HCI) and evaluation methods from natural language processing (NLP). Broadly speaking, my research falls under responsible AI (RAI). My work has been supported by The National GEM Consortium, Cornell’s Digital Life Initiative, and LinkedIn. I am also a member in Cornell's [AI Policy and Practice](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/) group and [CTRL-ALT](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/ctrl-alt) group.

Previously, I received a B.S., summa cum laude, in Computer Engineering from Florida A&M University. As an undergrad, I had a myriad of research experiences from biomedical engineering to ethics. I have worked on several patent matters at law firms and in-house.
