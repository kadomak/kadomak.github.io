Hi, I'm Kowe (co-weh)! I am a third year PhD student at Cornell Tech in Information Science. My research centers around users and developers. In the [Social Technologies Lab](https://s.tech.cornell.edu/), I develop evaluation frameworks and design interventions to support users in AI-mediated communication (AI-MC). I also explore how developers create fair algorithms and incorporate ethical principles into their work. I use mixed methods approaches and draw from computer science, sociolinguistics, ethics, and law in my work. My work has been supported by The National GEM Consortium and Cornell's Digital Life Initiative. I am also an active member in the [AI Policy and Practice](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/) group and [CTRL-ALT](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/ctrl-alt) group. 

Previously, I received a B.S., summa cum laude, in Computer Engineering from Florida A&M University. As an undergrad, I had a myriad of research experiences from biomedical engineering to ethics. I have worked on several patent matters at law firms and in-house.
